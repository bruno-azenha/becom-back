How does reach and time to live work:

1. At the database, we store the expiration time for a beacon

2. At regular periods of time, a scheduled procedure updates the
maximum reach of all beacons

3. Whenever a beacon is "liked", it's maximum reach and expiration time
is updated

The real reach and time to live of each beacon is shown and calculated
client-side using

For selecting which beacons we have to initially send to someone, we use 
the maximum reach that each beacon has. Then we verify if the beacon's actual
reach puts it at the person's reach.

4 - We may not even need the reach on the database
